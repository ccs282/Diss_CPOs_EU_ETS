# Putting Coal to Sleep in the Waterbed: Empirical EU ETS Price Reactions to Coal Phase-Outs
 
 Welcome to my dissertation's machine room. It is not necessarily perfectly tidy, but the engine runs smoothly. 
 
 The main file to replicate the findings is "LETS_GO.do", which draws upon most do-files in the repository as well as the csv-data. Therefore, download all files, save them in one folder, and run the main file. Make sure to install mmerge first if you have not done so already. 

 In the "LETS_GO.do"-file, you can also change the main event study parameters, such as model type, event and estimation window lengths etc. 

 Having run the main file, you can separately run the "MSFE.do"-file, which performance the forecasting performance calculations. 

 For questions related to the code, feel free to reach out to me via means available to you (through the department, for instance).

 Best,
